Zebrafish WT - PIA

2 clarkson samples:
1) 3 replicates for WT
2) 3 replicates for PIA

STEP 1: convert raw to mgf with msconvert tool
STEP 2: search in mascot using mass spectrometry data to identify proteins from a primary sequence database (search each sample by each replicate and by all replicates, so 4 searches per sample)
STEP 3: serial conversion of dats to csvs (run the ruby script on mascot server)

STEP 4: create a peptide list with the highest scored
		Applied filters:
		1) unique highest scored peptides => pep_score >=20
		3) only keep rank 1 peptides => pep_rank
		4) have expectancy cutoff => pep_expect <= 0.05
		5) (sort list by peptide score)
STEP 5: create a protein list with the unique proteins in each sample
STEP 6: create a list with all proteins identified in each sample, that don't overlap with the ones in the other samples
		Specifically, expressed in WT only, expressed in PIA only, expressed in both with ratio. 
		NOTE: For the non-common expressions, assign a flag and an extreme high/low ratio.

STEP 7: create a list with the identified proteins that are common in these experiments and calculate the significant and total 'matched peptides' normalized (ie normalize to the total spectral counts in WT1) ratios and log ratios for the differential expression, using the matched peptides abundance. 
		NOTE: In case there are 0 significant peptide matches, the log ratio is not calculated, leaving an empty cell.
